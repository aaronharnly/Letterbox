<h1>Creating Mail.app plugins with Aaron's Template</h1>
<p>Thanks for using my Mail.app plugin template!</p>

<p>If you have any comments or questions about using the template, or the process of
Mail.app plugin creation, feel free to contact me feel free to contact me:</p>

	<address>
		<div class="name">Aaron Harnly</div>
		<div class="email">my-first-name@harnly.net</div>
	</address>

<p>I can't write your plugin for you (actually, I can, for a reasonable fee),
but I'd be happy to help you out and orient you.</p>

<div class="note">
	All of the examples and screenshots below repeatedly use the name "MyPluginTemplate".
	<p>
		In your project, of course, this will be replaced with whatever you entered as your project's name.
	</p>
</div>

<ol>
	<li>
		<h2>Compile and load the stock plugin.</h2>

		<p>To get started, try compiling and running the template out of the box:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Select the <span class="target">Install for Debugging</span> target
				<p><img src="Readme_files/images/screenshots/target-install-for-debugging-context.png"></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Click <span class="button buildbutton"><img src="Readme_files/images/elements/button-build.png">Build</span> (or press <span class="key">⌘B</span>).
					
				</p>
				<p>
					This should compile without a problem – let me know if you encounter trouble!
				</p>

				<p>
					The <span class="target">Install for Debugging</span> target will also copy the plugin into your
					<span class="filepath folder">~/Library/Mail/Bundles</span> folder.
				</p>				
			</li>
			<li>
				Click <span class="button buildandgobutton"><img src="Readme_files/images/elements/button-build-and-go.png">Build and Go</span> (or press <span class="key">⌘⌥R</span>) to launch Mail.app.
				
				
				<div class="note">
					Selecting <span class="button debugbutton"><img src="Readme_files/images/elements/button-debug.png">Debug</span> (or pressing <span class="key"> ⌘⌥Y</span>) 
					
					will launch Mail.app with debugging 
					support, allowing you to set breakpoints and watchpoints within your plugin.</p>
				</div>
				
				<p>You should find confirmation of the plugin loading in the console:<br>
					<img src="Readme_files/images/screenshots/example-console.png">					
				<p>
					And, upon opening Mail's preferences, you should see an icon for your plugin's preference pane.
					(You might need to click the chevron on the right side of the toolbar to see it).
					<br>
					<img src="Readme_files/images/screenshots/example-prefs-chevron.png">
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h2>Customize your plugin's behavior</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Select the file:
				<div class="filepath file m">Plugin/MyPluginTemplateBundle.m</div>
				in Xcode, and use the method
					<div><code>-(void)initializeCustomizations</code></div>
				as your starting point to override Mail.app's default behavior.
			</li>
			<li>
				The <a href="http://www.fscript.org/">F-Script language</a> and the <a href="http://osiris.laya.com/blog/?p=24">F-Script Anywhere</a> application are invaluable tools
				for experimenting with Mail.app's classes and methods.
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					I've included header files (produced with <a href="http://www.codethecode.com/projects/class-dump/">class-dump</a>) for Mail.app, Message.framework, and the AppKit
					in the template, as shown here:
					<br>
					<img src="Readme_files/images/screenshots/project-apple-headers.png">					
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want to override or customize the behavior of an existing class from 
					one of these frameworks, I suggest that you consult the appropriate header file,
					then pull header for the class of interest into its own header file. You can then 
					reference that header file as needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, I've already done that with the 
					<code>MVMailBundle</code> class, which is the superclass for all Mail plugins:
					<br>
					<img src="Readme_files/images/screenshots/project-mail-headers.png">
				</p>				
			</li>
		</ul>		
	</li>

	<li>
		<h2>Customize icons</h2>
		<p>The plugin icon and logo images are generated from source images in the 
			<span class="filepath folder">Images</span> folder:
		</p>
		<div class="filepath file icns">Original-MyPluginTemplate-Icon.icns</div><br>
		<div class="filepath file tiff">Original-MyPluginTemplate-Image.tiff</div>
		
		<p>
			If both of these files are present, the <span class="filepath file icns">Icon.icns</span> file 
			is used to generate the icon, and the <span class="filepath file tiff">Image.tiff</span> file 
			to generate the logo image (and preferences pane image).
		</p>
		<p>
			If only one of these files is present, then that one file is used to generate both the icon and the logo image. 
			The conversion from .icns to .tiff and from .tiff to .icns is imperfect, which is why you have the option
			of generating both files yourself.
		</p>
	</li>
	
	<li><h2>Creating Release Notes</h2>
		<p>
			The template includes support for creation of simple release notes, 
			which can be automatically included in the distribution packages.
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				Make sure the <code>CFBundleVersion</code> key is appropriately 
				updated in <span class="filepath file plist">Plugin/Info.plist</span>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Select the <span class="target">Create Release Notes</span> target
			</li>
			<li>
				Click <span class="button buildbutton">Build</span> (or press <span class="key">⌘B</span>).
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>A file will be created in the <span class="filepath folder">AppCast-ReleaseNotes</span> folder:
			<br>
			<img src="Readme_files/images/screenshots/files-releasenotes.png">
			</p>
		<p>The file is generated from a template in <span class="filepath folder">SparklePlus-Templates</span>, which you can of course edit or replace.</p>					
	</li>
	
	<li><h2>Package for distribution via disk image</h2>
		<p>The template includes support for creating a disk image for simple double-click installation of the plugin.</p>

		<p>To generate a ready-to-distribute disk image:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Select the <span class="target">Package for Disk Image</span> target.
			</li>
			<li>
				Click <span class="button buildbutton">Build</span> (or press <span class="key">⌘B</span>).
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	
	<li><h2>Package for automatic updating with SparklePlus</h2>
	
		<p>
			The template supports auto-updating with a customized version of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sparkleplus/">SparklePlus framework</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			On startup, the plugin will check the URL (set by the <code>SUFeedURL</code> 
			key in the <span class="filepath file plist">Plugin/Info.plist</span> file)
			for an RSS 2.0 feed, as described in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sparkleplus/wiki/Overview">SparklePlus documentation</a>.
		</p> 
		<p>
			This URL is currently set to a dummy page on my own <a href="http://harnly.net">harnly.net</a> domain – obviously, you'll want 
			to change this to something appropriate.
		</p>

		<p>To build a version of the plugin ready for appcasting:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Make sure the <code>CFBundleVersion</code> key is appropriately updated in 
				<span class="filepath file plist">Plugin/Info.plist</span>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Select the <span class="target">Package for Appcast</span> target.
			</li>
			<li>
				Click <span class="button buildbutton">Build</span> (or press <span class="key">⌘B</span>).
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>A directory will be generated:
			<br>
			<img src="Readme_files/images/screenshots/files-appcast.png">
			<br>
			containing a zipped copy of the mailbundle, 
			a file named <span class="filepath file xml">appcast-item.xml</span> appropriate for inclusion in an RSS feed, 
			and a file named <span class="filepath file xml">appcast.xml</span> which is a valid RSS 2.0 feed, 
			containing this version's item as the only item.
		</p>

		<p>If you want to test the appcasting:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Generate an appcast-ready version to run in Mail.</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Set the <code>CFBundleVersion</code> key in <span class="filepath file plist">Plugin/Info.plist</span> to something appropriate						
						<div class="example">(e.g., <code>1.0</code>).</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						Set the <code>SUFeedURL</code> key in <span class="filepath file plist">Plugin/Info.plist</span> to something appropriate 
						<div class="example">(e.g., <code>http://localhost/plugin/appcast.xml</code>).</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						Select the <span class="target">Install for Debugging</span> target.
					</li>
					<li>
						Click <span class="button buildbutton">Build</span> (or press <span class="key">⌘B</span>)
						to copy the plugin into <span class="filepath folder">~/Library/Mail/Bundles</span>.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Generate an appcast and appcast enclosure.</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Update the <code>CFBundleVersion</code> key in <span class="filepath file plist">Plugin/Info.plist</span> to a larger value 
							<div class="example">(e.g., <code>1.1</code>).</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						Update the templates in <span class="filepath folder">AppCast-Templates</span> so that the enclosure URLs point to an appropriate place
						<div class="example">(e.g., <code>http://localhost/plugin/appcast/v__VERSION__/MyPluginTemplate.mailbundle.zip</code>).</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						Select the <span class="target">Package for Appcast</span> target.
					</li>
					<li>
						Click <span class="button buildbutton">Build</span> (or press <span class="key">⌘B</span>)
						to generate the appcast directory.
					</li>
					<li>
						Copy the files from the appcast directory to the appropriate place on your server
						<div class="example">
							(<span class="filepath folder">/Library/WebServer/Documents/plugin/appcast</span> in our example.)
						</div>

						<p>
							Now launch Mail, and you should receive the update notification,
							and be able to download and install the "update".
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	
	<li><h2>Signing Your SparklePlus Appcasts</h2>

		<p>The template makes it very easy to ensure the security of your appcast by signing your appcast enclosures.</p>
		<p>To use appcast signing, just do these three very simple steps:</p>
			<h3>Quick Steps For The Hasty</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Select the <span class="target">Generate Appcasting Keys</span> target.
					</li>
					<li>
						Click <span class="button buildbutton">Build</span> (or press <span class="key">⌘B</span>).
					</li>
					<li>
						Open the <span class="filepath file plist">Plugin/Info.plist</span> file, and edit the 
						key <code>SUExpectsDSASignature,</code>
						changing it from <code>&lt;false/&gt;</code> 
						to <code>&lt;true/&gt;</code>.
				</ol>
				
			<h3>Explanation For The Thorough</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>Generating the Appcast Keys</h4>
					
					<p>Step 2 generated your Appcast keys.</p>
					<p>This should have run for a good 20-30 seconds, as the private and public keys are generated.
					Once this step is complete, you should find the keys within the 
					<span class="filepath folder">AppCast-Keys</span> folder:</p>

					<div class="note">
						You can tell the project to find (or generate) the keys elsewhere by changing the 
						<div class="projvar">DSA_private_key_file</div> 
						and 
						<div class="projvar">DSA_public_key_file</div>
						variables in the project build settings:
						<br>
						<img src="Readme_files/images/screenshots/project-dsa-settings.png">
						<br>
					</div>
						
					<p>You should also find that the 
						<span class="filepath file plist">Plugin/Info.plist</span>file 
						has been updated to include the public key.
					</p>
					<p>The <code>SUPublicDSAKey</code> key should have changed from this:
						<br>
						<img src="Readme_files/images/screenshots/example-pubkey-placeholder.png">
						<br>
						to something like this:
						<br>
						<img src="Readme_files/images/screenshots/example-pubkey-long.png">
						<br>
					</p>
					
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Requiring Appcast Signing</h4>

						<p>After you've changed the key <code>SUExpectsDSASignature</code>, when the plugin finds and downloads 
					a SparklePlus update, it will first check to ensure that the feed contains a DSA signature, and 
					that the signature was generated by your private key. </p>

					<p>The <span class="target">Package for Appcast</span> target takes care of this automatically, 
						generating the <span class="filepath file txt">signature.base64.txt</span> file 
					 	from the zipped mailbundle, and adding that signature to the 
						<span class="filepath file xml">appcast-item.xml</span> file.
					</p>
					</li>
				</ul>			
	</li>
	
</ol>






<p>Good luck!</p>
